# S3TemplateEngine
A lightweigth template engine for AWS serverless computing, that helps you to create AWS S3 / AWS CloudFront hosted websites. Optionally integrates Webiny.

## Motivation
AWS S3 and AWS Cloudfront offer a great platform to publish websites and web apps at a low cost. However you need to crate the HTML files elsewhere and it can be a pain to get everything up and running without a decent CMS. 

**This project is for you, if** you want to manually create HTML and benefit form low cost serverless computing, but still want to:
 * Reuse code snipptes (like header or navigation)
 * Use a CMS for updating your content 
 * Automatically create pages dynamically (like a individual page for each article you put in a system, ratehr than a SEO unfriendly AJAX load of content on a generic page)
 * Have a pipline that optimizes/minifies your code output

## Concept
AWS S3 and AWS Cloudfront offer a great platform to publish websites and web apps at a low cost. S3TemplateEngine uses servless technologies (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cloudformation) to provide you with an easy template language to use these in a more powerfull way. All you have to do is to follow the installtion paragraph and once S3TemplateEngine is up and running, you can write your own HTML based templates, put them into a specific S3 bucket and see the magic happen.
